Hello,

Thank you for registering to ALJCepeda.com. This is a confirmation email for registering username: {{username}}. Successfully completing this registration process will also subscribe this email ({{email}}) to our mailing list which will keep you informed of major releases. Don't worry, we won't email you unless it's super duper important :).


Here is the typical confirmation email which will complete your registration: {{confirmationLink}}. Please keep in mind you'll be asked to provide a password to secure your login, it needs to atleast 8 characters long, contain 1 uppercase letter, 1 number and 1 special character.

Also keep in mind that link will expire on {{expiresOn}}. If you haven't clicked it on it by {{expiresOn}} you'll have to fill out my rediculously long sign up sheet all over again :(. 


Stand by for my awesome new app 'Echo'. All I'm going to say is it's a location based messaging system and if you have a phone with GPS, you're going to love it.

Thank you you for your support!
