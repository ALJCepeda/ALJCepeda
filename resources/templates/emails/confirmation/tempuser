Hello {{username}},

Thank you for registering to ALJCepeda.com! Who knows, you might find something useful on here ... eventually. Anyways, completing this registration process will also subscribe you to my mailing list which will keep you informed of major releases. Don't worry, I won't email you unless it's super duper important and you can opt out at anytime :).


Here's the typical confirmation link which will complete your registration: 
{{confirmationLink}}. 

And here's some important details you might like to know:

Username: {{username}}
Password: {{password}}
Email: {{email}}
Expiration: {{expiresOn}}

If you haven't completed your registration by the expiration, you'll have to fill out my ridiculously long sign up sheet again :(. You'll be given a chance to change your password when you click on the link above, it needs to be at least 8 characters long, contain 1 uppercase letter, 1 number and 1 special character. 


Stand by for my awesome new app 'Echo'. All I'm going to say is it's a location based messaging system and if you have a phone with GPS, you're going to love it.

Thank you for your support!
