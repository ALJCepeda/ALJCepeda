   	<h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>To the domain of a restless mind</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>This website is laid out using CSS3 Flexbox, new technology that has it's issues. Some things don't display correctly in Safari, and probably Internet Explorer. 

    <br />
    <br />
    The website has been confirmed to work on the latest Chrome and Firefox browsers.
    <br />
    Sorry, but I really can't be bothered to support outdated browsers and properietary tech.</p>
