<h1>Device Repair</h1>
<p> Along with Software Engineering I'm able to perform minor hardware repairs on computers, game console and some small smart devices. The following pictures are of a recent repair on an iPad Mini. Apple would have charged me $200 to do this repair, but I was able to get it done for $50. </p>

<p> The iPad's digitizer is removed exposing the underlying LCD screen. You can visibly see the damage to the LCD even with the power turned off. I didn't have all the right tools at the time and had to pry off the digitizer in order to separate it from the adhesive. Since then I've purchased a heat gun to avoid going through the hassle.</p>

<p> Here is what lies underneath the LCD screen. As you can see the battery takes up most of the room in the device, which is typical for smart devices. Take a look at how big your cellphone battery is to get an idea. In this picture I've also completely removed the digitizer and LCD screen in preparation for their replacements.</p>

<p> Finally we have the repaired product, looking clean, slick and plugged in waiting to be tested. The original digitizer is still intact, functional and can be used to as a spare part in the future. </p>

<p> Hurray! Working and ready for the best game available on the iOS marketplace, Faster Than Light: FTL. Get it now and fulfill your childhood dreams of being a two dimensional space captain, you'll thank me later :D</p>
