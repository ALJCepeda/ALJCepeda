		<p>The battle against the empire of bad developers rages on! The evil forces of ignorance have proven to be a daunting foe and worthy adversary for our warriors of light</p>
		<br />

		<p>Our heroes were last seen heavily outnumbered by an angry mob of recent graduates. Cries of self importance rang through the Valley of Flex</p>

		<br />
		<p class="center">"Profesionally Certified! ... "</p>
		<p class="center">"Prestigious Recognition! ... "</p>
		<p class="center">"Four years of theoretical knowledge! ... "</p>
		<p class="center">"The best money can buy! ... "</p>

		<br />
		<p>It seemed all hope was lost and the light side of the knowledge would be lost to the evil empire's most fearsome weapon... commercialism.</p>

		<br />
		<p>"Never!", roared our favorite nerd of wonder, "We are bright! We are innovative and we are strong! Lets us stand together as brothers and fight for the future!"</p>

		<p>Words were exchanged and swords clashed as an epic battle ensued ... one that continues to this day.</p> 

		<br />
		<p>I hold a strong opinion, a unique wordly world view and an undying passion for software. If you strive to develop the best quality software possible then we should talk :)</p>
