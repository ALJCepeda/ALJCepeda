            <div class='body text-center'>
        		<p>I graduated from the University of Central Florida with a Bachelor's of Science in Interdisciplinary studies with a focus on Computer Science and Physical Science</p>
        		<br />
        		<p>I first became interested in programming when I was 13. After turning my PC into a dedicated Counter-Strike server I installed AMXModX which allowed me to create several popular plugins and amaze my friends</p>
        		<br />
        		<br />
        		<p>Since then I've been enthralled with the world learning anything and everything I can. I'm not just a Software Engineer, I'm a philosopher, a physicist, a mathematician and a teacher. I love anything that makes me think and I share my knowledge with anyone that'll listen.</p>
        		<br />
        		<br />
        		<p>I honestly love this world and I have a great deal of pride in the work I do. I'm searching for a place that shares my passion, welcomes unique perspectives and strives for a better tomorrow</p>
